# FastQC exercise

In this exercise you perform QC on a pair of MiSeq reads, using the FastQC software.

FastQC can be installed on Windows [using these installation instructions](https://zwets.it/course/fastqc/windows-fastqc-install.pdf).

Note that the reads are a subset of the full output for the isolate (otherwise the
files would be too large), causing some artifacts in the graphs that you can ignore.

However the report for read 1 shows one clear quality issue.  What is it?

The report for read 2 shows a pattern typical for the reverse read.  What is this?

Input files:

 * [EC505_subset_R1.fastq.gz](https://zwets.it/course/fastqc/EC505_subset_R1.fastq.gz)
 * [EC505_subset_R2.fastq.gz](https://zwets.it/course/fastqc/EC505_subset_R2.fastq.gz)
