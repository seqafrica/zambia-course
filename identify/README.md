# Identify Unknown Species

In this exercise you use BLAST, KmerFinder, and/or PathogenWatch to identify
species for a set of genome assemblies.

Each team should pick two consecutive isolates from the list.  Use one or
more of the above tools to find out what species they are.

The *odd* numbered isolates are high quality assemblies.  The *even* numbered
assemblies have a quality issue.  Try and find out what the issue is.

The assemblies can be found [here](https://zwets.it/course/identify).
